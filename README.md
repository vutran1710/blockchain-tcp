# blockchain-tcp

Blockchain TCP Network, with the following goals:

1. Proof-of-Stake, or maybe Hybrid (if i can implement in the future)
2. Nodes  communicates over decentralized TCP network
3. Using Clojure, the most beautiful functional language imo.
4. Using Aleph (http://aleph.io) for stream-programming & TCP server/client setup

## Clone

## Usage

```
TO BE ANNOUNCED
```

## State of development
For the moment, i'm pretty stuck with multi-client + multi-server to make the app really decentralized. Since it's been so time-consuming, I will temporarily move on with something else and certainly come back to this in a near future. Stay tuned!
